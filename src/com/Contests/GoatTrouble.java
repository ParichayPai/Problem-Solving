/*
You have a house, which you model as an axis-aligned rectangle with corners at (x1, y1) and (x2, y2).
You also have a goat, which you want to tie to a fence post located at (x, y), with a rope of length
l. The goat can reach anywhere within a distance l from the fence post.
Find the largest value of l so that the goat cannot reach your house.
Input
Input consists of a single line with six space-separated integers x, y, x1, y1, x2, and y2. All the
values are guaranteed to be between âˆ’1000 and 1000 (inclusive).
It is guaranteed that x1 < y1 and x2 < y2, and that (x, y) lies strictly outside the axis-aligned
rectangle with corners at (x1, y1) and (x2, y2).
Output
Print, on one line, the maximum value of l, rounded and displayed to exactly three decimal places.
